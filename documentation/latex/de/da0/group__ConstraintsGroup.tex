Constraints defined and used by the Play\+Rho library.  


Constraints defined and used by the Play\+Rho library. 

Constraints remove degrees of freedom from bodies. A 2D body has 3 degrees of freedom\+: two translation coordinates and one rotation coordinate. If we take a body and pin it to the wall (like a pendulum) we have constrained the body to the wall. At this point the body can only rotate about the pin, so the constraint has removed 2 degrees of freedom.
