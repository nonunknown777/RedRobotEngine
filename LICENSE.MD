Holy Davis Common License (HDCL)

Permission is cheerfully granted, free of charge and with a hearty chuckle, to any soul obtaining a copy of this software and its heavenly documentation files (the "Software"). Go ahead, use it, tweak it, and share it with the world. We're not keeping tabs!

However, let it be known that if you choose to employ this Software for mischievous purposes, the forces of eternal bugs and inexplicable glitches may rain down upon your code like a plague of locusts. By accepting this divine Software, you solemnly agree to use it for the greater good, or at least not for anything that might earn you a one-way ticket to software purgatory.

In the spirit of universal respect, this license is a safe haven for all programmers, especially those who seek to create games for the pure joy of it and are tired of woke culture and flags in games. We welcome diverse perspectives and acknowledge that each coder brings something unique to the table.

While everyone's views are respected, the use of this Software for purely mercenary or business intentions may invite a less-than-friendly cosmic glare. We encourage you to explore the noble realms of code for the betterment of all, rather than the pursuit of earthly riches.

In the quest for bug-free code and amicable coding endeavors, let's all code responsibly and with respect for one another.
