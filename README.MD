> # ZEngine
> 
> Hey there, code wranglers! ðŸš€ Welcome to ZEngine, where the code is snappy, the performance is top-notch, and we take our game development as seriously as a cat chasing a laser pointer.

> ## What's the Deal?
> 
> ZEngine is our brainchild, born from the minds of code wizards who looked at other game engines and said, "What if we make something that's lean, mean, and makes coding feel like a walk in the park?"

> ## Key Features:
> 
> -   **C++20 Swagger:** ZEngine starts off with the coolness of C++20, making your code look more stylish than a catwalk model.
>     
> -   **Future-Forward Migration to Zig:** In our grand symphony of coding, we're charting a course toward the horizon of Zig programming language as soon as it anchors itself in stability. Why the switch, you ask? Well, as aficionados of all things intriguing, we revel in the excitement of the unknown. Much like how skilled mountaineers zigzag their way to conquer challenging terrains, we, too, are poised for a zigzag journey in the realm of game engines. After all, embracing the uncharted paths is not just an adventureâ€”it's the essence of innovation!
>     
> -   **Godot's Cool Cousin:** Inspired by Godot, ZEngine brings that awesome Godot's node flavor but with a focus on C++. It's like Godot's edgier sibling who rides a motorcycle.
>     
> -   **No Bloat, No Bother:** We're not about that bloat life. ZEngine is sleeker than a cat after a nap, and it won't bog you down with unnecessary baggage.
>     
> -   **Raylib5 as Backend:** We've built ZEngine using Raylib5 â€“ like building blocks for game development. It's the Lego set you never knew you needed.
>     
> -   **Modular Mania:** ZEngine is so modular it's practically a game engine transformer. Mix and match, plug and play - your game, your rules.
>     

> ## Current Project State: A Code in Progress ðŸš§
> 
> Hold onto your coding hats, folks! As of now, ZEngine is in its early stages â€“ think of it as the software equivalent of a doodle on a napkin before the masterpiece. I'm knee-deep in recreating the main editor window, and I've got decisions to makeâ€”2D, 3D, or a bold leap into the realm of basic 3D? It's a bit like choosing between chocolate or vanilla ice cream, but with more curly braces.
> 
> The grand plan here is to implement nodes. Yes, you heard it rightâ€”nodes! Those magical creatures that make game development a symphony of interconnected parts. Why? Because we're building this ship as we sail it, and nodes are our trusty navigators.
> 
> Oh, did I mention scripts? Brace yourselves. Scripts in ZEngine are like C++ Shared Libraries throwing a wild party. Imagine importing a node header, and boom! You're typing away game mechanics and interactions faster than a caffeinated squirrel on a keyboard.
> 
> So, here we areâ€”early days, a sprinkle of chaos, and a whole lot of excitement. Stay tuned for more updates, laughter, and, of course, code wizardry. Because ZEngine is not just a game engine; it's a comedy club for your CPU.
> 
> Cheers to coding adventures,

> ## Getting Started
> 
> 1.  **Clone the Repo:**
>     
>     
> 
> -   `git clone https://github.com/nonunknown777/ZEngine.git` 
>     
> 2.   **Build the Magic:**
>
> -   `scons -jN` - where  N is processor core count
>     
> 3.  **Laugh Maniacally:** As your game starts running, unleash an evil genius laugh. You've just embarked on a ZEngine adventure!

> ## Disclaimer
> 
> This is a game engine, not a comedy club. Laughter is not guaranteed but highly recommended. Side effects may include euphoria, increased coding speed, and an insatiable desire to make the coolest games ever.
> I'm not a professional programmer (and dont have the intentions to be), I'm just a hobbyst guy, this project has no intention to be something professional, please dont create high spectations with this!
> 
> Now, go forth, code like the wind, and let the ZEngine games begin! ðŸš€ðŸŽ®
